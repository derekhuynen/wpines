                        <p>The Big Bear Lake Oktoberfest kicks-off 50+ years of German Tradition on Saturday, Sept. 11th and
                            continues through Sunday, Nov. 7th. We’ve been told something special happens when friends and
                            family come together for a party high in the mountains, under the pines, and 50+ years in the
                            making. In these moments memories are created, life is celebrated and you swear every heart
                            beats as one!</p>

                        <p>Last year we celebrated 50 years of love and went back to our roots.! It was amazing. . . we
                            learned in difficult times celebrating with those that matter most is important.</p>

                        <p>It’s time for Oktoberfest magic, love and hope to fill our fresh mountain air. It’s time for
                            family and friends to come together to celebrate and create a memory or two. It’s time for a
                            reason to smile…</p>


                        <h3>2021 General Admission:</h3>

                        <p>The 2021 Oktoberfest will offer limited capacity. The good news is that this year we are
                            celebrating both inside and outside. And, while our favorite bands from Germany still can not
                            fly into the United States, we’ve lined up some awesome German-American bands to help us
                            celebrate this year. Rest assured we are gearing up for a Fall party like no other!</p>
