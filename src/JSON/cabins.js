Check out the natural beauty and serenity of the area while hiking to Castle Rock, biking the Alpine Pedal Path, or exploring restaurants and shopping that are all within easy reach. Then in the cool evening curl up by the fire in our perfectly appointed cabin for 4. We can provide a safe storage place for your personal bike. Military Friendly. We have a no pet policy."
